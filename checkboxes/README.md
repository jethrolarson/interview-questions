# Setup

1. clone this repository
2. `npm install` this folder
3. `npm start` to start the dev server

In another terminal `npm run watch`

# Challenge

Given the `options` data structure, render a group of checkboxes.
You may use any libraries you like, open book, google whatever.
I've included setup options for vanilla-js, react, jsx, and TypeScript as a convenience. See `public/index.html` for switching modes. Feel free to challenge requirements or ask whatever questions.

Bonus points:

- Testability
- A11y
- HTML best practices
- Design sensibilities
- TypeScript
