You may use any libraries you like, open book, google whatever.
I've included setup options for vanilla-js, react, jsx, and TypeScript as a convenience. See `public/index.html` for switching modes. Feel free to challenge requirements or ask whatever questions.

Bonus points:
* Testability
* A11y
* HTML best practices
* Design sensibilities
* TypeScript
